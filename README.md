# Spotify Track Popularity – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores relationships between Spotify audio features, song structure, and track popularity.

## Key Questions
- How are audio features related to each other?
- Do individual audio attributes explain popularity?
- Does genre, explicit content, or duration influence popularity?

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

## Summary
The analysis finds that while audio features exhibit clear internal structure, no single feature strongly determines popularity. Popularity appears to be influenced by a combination of musical, contextual, and external factors.
